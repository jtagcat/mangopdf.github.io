## flashy and good intro

The year is 2077AD. Where are all your friends? 

Your friends have all uploaded themselves to the cloud. Your friend who's "gonna start a band one day" is 13% of the way there. As you look over the rubble-spotted desert, you think to yourself: _where did I go wrong?_ (_damn i wish i was good at hacking_) etc. etc.

buckle up kiddo, we're gonna commit digital sin


## What is this?
It's your first day of class and you're slacking off already? (yikes)

If you think you might want to become an all-powerful hacker to slay your enemies, but don't know where to learn the ancient, forbidden art, this is for you. It's what I wish I knew when I was starting, back in 2067.

  * lockpicking/physical
  * social engineering
  * the culture (oo boy purplecon)
  * hacking without a computer (e.g. form process abuse)
* How do I learn hacking?
* Why do hackers hack? money
* talk about threat modelling
* the dark web?
* government hacking?
* what do i do to stay safe? motherboard guide to not getting hacked

You just understand something really well
and think "what could go wrong"
you need a lot of raw courage, to spend hours reading the official docs for how something works, treating it like a challenge. "did they make a mistake anywhere?"
If you think the work is cool, you'll work a lot harder on it.
Hacking is addictive because the enticement of hacking something is very motivating. "If this works, I'll get famous!" "If this works, I'll be powerful!"

Do what's fun for you. Find something that you really like, and already spend a lot of time doing (a game, a youtube channel,  a sports team you're on (or any regular meeting)), and use the knowledge you already have of how it works. Ask yourself, what could go wrong?

 How does that mobile game know that you have to wait 30 minutes before your next action? Is it just using your phone clock? It works offline, so maybe it is. Try changing your phone clock and seeing what happens.

How does the youtube channel know when to post videos? Have you noticed the videos are the same time each day? Can you guess the timezone of the youtuber based on this? Do they maybe keep notes somewhere on the internet of what videos they're going to post? Can you predict what they're going to post on youtube based on their instagram story?

How does your sports team know where and when to meet for practice? Is there a Facebook group or something? Are the privacy settings okay? What if the group is set to public? Can an evil opposing team see your schedule and book the practice field before you, so you have nowhere to practice?

All of these examples aren't using special hacking cheat codes. They're just understanding something really well, and thinking about it from the perspective of an attacker. The only "secret" thing about hacking, is the mindset you use. Most people don't think about what could go wrong, because, most of the time, things go right. It costs too much brain energy to consider what could go wrong all the time. For example, do you think about whether you need a double lock on your front door? Bars on your windows? You probably don't, because you don't think about people breaking in to your house, because most of the time when you get home, your house is fine.
The "secret" hacking mindset (also called "threat modelling") is this:
• What is valuable?
• How could it be stolen/damaged
• Who would be motivated to attack it?
• How would they be likely to do it?

Here's that applied to the 3 examples from before


Mobile game
• What is valuable? -> doing actions
• How could it be stolen/damaged -> the timer could be modified
• Who would be motivated to attack it? -> players
• How would they be likely to do it? -> changing their clock

Youtube channel
• What is valuable? -> spoilers on future videos
• How could it be stolen/damaged -> youtuber might accidentally leak it in a subtle way
• Who would be motivated to attack it? -> obsessed fans
• How would they be likely to do it? -> stalking the youtuber's online presence

Sports team
• What is valuable? -> your practice venue reservation
• How could it be stolen/damaged -> someone could book it before you do
• Who would be motivated to attack it? -> opposing teams
• How would they be likely to do it? -> find your practice time/place, book before you do


Just do it
Don't google it and github it, turn off the internet and do it???
You learn more by flubbing

Do a thing someone else has done before, but without looking at their work, do it from first principles

GOOD advice, take whatever else that you're interested, and combine it with security, like car jacking, etc. If you join your interests, it's GOOD

# Part 1: Sunday afternoon

Heyyyyyy you know when you're like, flopping about at home, absolutely minding your own business, having a nice drink from your water bottle in a way that does not possess _any_ intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia? 

It's a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in "the group chat"[^groupchat].

![Can you hack this man?](/img/sunburnt-country/groupchat.png)
*A nice message from my friend 🙂. A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences.*

[^groupchat]: It's one of those group chats where the name is constantly changing and you have no idea who "illegally downloaded plant farmer" is.

The man in question is [Tony Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott), one of Australia's many former Prime Ministers. 

For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.

But like don't get me wrong, I love Australia, let's be honest the [national anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR9iY5y94s) fricken slaps. I just really wanted to say that multiple websites thing.

Here's where it all goes wrong though. My friend's message linked to a public Instagram[^instagram] post by Tony Abbott, a picture of a boarding pass and baggage receipt for a flight to Sydney. 

[^instagram]: A lot of people don't know that Instagram is actually short for Instantaneous Grammarphone, because it isn't true.

![Instagram post showing boarding pass](/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG)
*The since-deleted Instagram post showing the boarding pass and baggage receipt. This picture and I have been through a lot together.*

My friend[^hoggemoade] (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking[^onbehalf] whether I can "hack this man" not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we'd recently been talking about boarding passes.

[^hoggemoade]: As for my friend's nickname being "𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊", I will not be providing context at this time.

[^onbehalf]: On behalf of _another_ friend, my many friends a consequence of my outstanding patriotic efforts towards continuing to avoid subversion of the Commonwealth of Australia.

### Earlier: Boarding passes
Months ago, I'd said something in the chat like:

---
> yeah my dude

> people post pictures of their boarding pass all the time

> but they don't know their boarding pass can be used to get their passport number and stuff

> so they just post it being like 

> "omg going on holidayyyy"

> meanwhile some hacker is rubbing their hands together, all "yumyum identity fraud 👀"

> and having a vigorous browse of #flight, #airport, etc. on instagram trying to find more

> brb i gotta go act in the interests of the commonwealth of australia some more

---

### Disclaimer

Of course, my friend wasn't _actually_ asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

𝑯𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I mean... What would you do, if you had that message in front of you? Would you _not_ click it? Are you gonna let a _link_ that's like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn't you be _curious_? The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Is that _bad_? I don't know. What I do know is: the _least_ I can do for my country would be to have a casual browse[^nocrime].

[^nocrime]: To be clear, I didn't want to go do some fun casual identity fraud, I just wanted to know if he _had_ posted something secret, since uh, someone should probably do something about that if it were true (I insist, as they calmly read me my rights). 

### Step 1: Hubris

A casual browse later, I had the picture of the boarding pass, but didn't really know what to do next.

I'd heard that it's bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a Russian 15 year-old with an anime avatar might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don't know anyone like that, so I clumsily Googled "uhhh boarding pass hacking".

Eventually I found [an article](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/) explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can be used for Crimes, and the valuable part is the barcode.

Apparently the barcode on the boarding pass contains the "Booking Reference" (e.g. H8JA2A), which you use to log in to the airline website. That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but I'm willing to conveniently forget to note that out loud if you are.

### Step 2: Scan the barcode
I've been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can't scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn't work.

![Picture of barcode scanning failing?](/img/sunburnt-country/barcodescan_fail.png)


### Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more

//TODO replace with screenshot of photoshop
![](/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png)
*Maybe I shouldn't have blurred out the barcode first.*

I spent around 15 minutes in an "enhance, ENHANCE" montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn't even get the barcode to scan[^step3].

[^step3]:You can't just _have_ step 3. You have to _earn it_.

### Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper

After staring at this image for fifteen minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is printed on the baggage receipt. I graduated university.

![Boarding pass with booking reference highlighted](/img/sunburnt-country/bookingrefhighlighted.png)
*askdjhaflajkshdflkh*

### Step 3: Visit the airline's website

Having used my image editing skills to get the Booking Reference, I went to [qantas.com.au](https://qantas.com.au), and clicked "Manage Booking". Qantas is the main airline here in Australia, in case you live in a country with fast internet.

![](/img/sunburnt-country/entering_booking_ref.png)
*Part of collection "Pictures taken moments before disaster" (2020), 1920x1080, pixel on canvas*

### Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference 
I was looking at the same login page I'd used to check in to flights. It asked for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just effortlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well... I knew the last name[^lastname].

[^lastname]: The last name is printed on the baggage receipt, too. So even if I didn't know who posted the picture, everything you need to manage the booking is right there on the baggage receipt in a neat little package.

I hesitated for a split-second, but... no, I had to know.

I hit Enter, and saw this.

![Logged in "Manage Booking" page](loggedin)

# Crimes(?)

It worked. 

![Passenger name, FF number, Flight destination and times screenshot](/img/sunburnt-country/sdff.png)
*"Welcome, Mr. Abbott". How long I'd waited to hear those words.*

### Denial
_"Surely this can't be happening. SURELY anyone who saw that Instagram post couldn't be looking at this page with me right now."_

### Anger
_"Why the HECK are there so many versions of Minecraft for Windows 10, why the hEcK are there MineCoins™ this isn't the future Hatsune Miku wanted."_

### Bargaining
_"Maybe this page doesn't have anything interesting in it."_

Everything on the page looked public. Can't do much with the passenger name and flight schedule.

There was a Frequent Flyer number? The page informed me that this flight had been booked by a travel agent, so some information would be missing. But that's not _that_ bad. Right?

I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length to the end of the page, but still didn't find anything secret-looking. 

At the very end, in what was a somewhat surreal experience, I was farewelled by an ad telling me (Tony Abbott?) to rent a car in Melbourne. 

![Car Ad](/img/sunburnt-country/sdff.png)
*No, Qantas, I shall not go gently into that good night. You don't understand.*

For a moment, I felt relieved. 

Maybe this wasn't such a big deal after all. 

### Depression
_"That papery-thin login screen is all that stands in the way of hackers. Security is a lie. We're all trapped in a heck of our own design."_


### Acceptance
_"At least things can't get any worse."_

𝑵𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒐𝒓: "But they could."

---

// Those five stages I'd never heard any experimental evidence about.
I didn't see anything particularly juicy on the page, but we weren't done just because a _web page_ said we were done. 

Sometimes there are juicy things hidden in the page's source code (HTML), which you wouldn't be able to see just by looking at the page.

This is the only step in this story that might be considered "hacking". It's not, though.

Suddenly wearing sunglasses, I depressed the right-hand button of my mouse, bringing a textual menu under the mouse cursor into existence. Power and glory. Using my superior intellect, I dragged the mouse pointer to the bottom of the menu, summoned all my courage, and allowed it to pour through my finger as I left-clicked on the "Inspect Element" menu item in such a way that it was clear I possessed godlike hacking abilities.

![Right click > Inspect](/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/8uZgKCe.png)
*dw, i clicked block*

I cannot stress enough the degree to which this is not an elite hacker tool. 

It's used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: You cannot understand how a website works. It cannot be done. Unfortunately, it sure _looks_ like hacking the first time you see it.

"Inspect Element", as it's called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer's representation (HTML) of the page you're looking at. Everything you see when you use it was already on your computer, you just hadn't asked Chrome to show it to you yet.

![Diagram explaining HTML rendering to page you can look at](/img/inspect-element-diagram.png)



If you'd like to know more about it [I've prepared a short video](https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432).

---

![Screenshot of inspect element tab open]()

I scrolled around through the HTML and eventually got to a big pile of JSON data. I skimmed through it, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.

I eventually realised that manually reading JSON with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F'd the HTML for "passport".

![Blurred screenshot of me ctrl + F-ing these terms instead of json]()

## Oh _no_

Oh yes.

It's just _there_.

It was next to `documentNumber`, which was a number that sure _looked_ like a passport number. I googled "tony abbott" and checked the birthday on his Wikipedia page. It matched the birthday on the passport.

At this point I was pretty sure I was looking at the _extremely_ secret government-issued ID of the _28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II_ and I was _kinda_ worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop.

## What else is in here?

If there's a passport number in this webpage, maybe there's even more? A phone number maybe? Searching for `phone` and `number` didn't get anywhere, so I tried searching for `614`, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number. _That_ led me to a whole lot of _this_:

```
RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 61[redacted passenger phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
```

It keeps going, too. It's labelled `PNRRemarks`. 

In what is surely the subtweeting of the century, it also has a section saying "HITOMI CALLED RQSTING FASTTRACK FOR MR. ABBOTT". 

![Blurred picture of PNRRemarks section showing "hitomi called"]()

Who _is_ Hitomi? The flight was from Tokyo to Sydney, so presumably she works at Qantas in Tokyo. She must be requesting a "fast-track" (I thought that was only a thing in movies???) from another Qantas employee. 

Hey for real though? For reeeal though? What is even going on here? Why do Qantas flight staff talk to eachother via this passenger information field? Why do they send the messages about you _to_ you when you manage your booking?

### Forbidden airline code

I realised the allcaps spaghetti must be some airline code for something, and eventually found several ancient forbidden PDFs that explained some of the codes. 

Apparently, they're called "SSR codes" (Special Service Request). There are codes for things like "Vegetarian lacto-ovo meal" (`VLML`), "Vegetarian oriental meal" (`VOML`), and even "Vegetarian vegan meal" (`VGML`). Because I was curious about these codes, here's some for you to be curious about too:

```
RFTV    Reason for Travel
UMNR    Unaccompanied minor
PDCO    Carbon Offset (chargeable)
WEAP    Weapon
DEPA    Deportee—accompanied by an escort
ESAN    Passenger with Emotional Support Animal in Cabin
```

The phone number I saw said `CTCM QF HK1 [phone number]`. Googling "SSR CTCM" led me to the [developer guide](https://guides.developer.iata.org/docs/ctcm) for some kind of airline association, which I assume I am basically a member of now.

![CTCM](/img/sunburnt-country/ctcm.png)

Moving right along from the weirdly-off spelling of "passenger's", this was enough for me to translate `CTCM QF HK1` as "Contact phone number of passenger 1". 

I thought maybe the phone number belonged to the travel agency that booked the flight, but I [checked](https://portal.iata.org/faq/articles/en_US/FAQ/Is-it-mandatory-for-travel-agents-to-provide-the-passenger-s-mobile-phone-and-email-address-1448977338174) and it has to be the passenger's real phone number. That would be.... Tony Abbott's phone number.

## what have i done

I'd now found Tony Abbott's:
* Passport details
* Phone number
* Weird Qantas staff comments.

My friend who messaged me had _no idea_.

## what have i _done_


At this point I'd had enough defending my country and was thinking:

* _oh jeez oh boy oh jeez_
* _i gotta get someone, somehow, to reset tony abbott's passport number_
* _can you even reset passport numbers_
* _is it possible that i've done a crime_

# Part 2: The next month

I didn't _think_ any of this sounded like a crime, but you see, sometimes when the other person is rich or famous, things can suddenly _become_ crimes.

So I did what anyone would do in this situation: immediately reported my actions to the Government.

I googled "tony abbott contact". 

* website
* contact us form
* nah
* liam?
* check screenshots



































* Trying his website
* Calling the party
* Giving up and asking hacker friends
* 1300 cyber1
* left on read by the government
* mango.pdf.zone refs
* lawyerssss
* emailing qantas
* talking to journalists

* i deleted all the stuff dw

# Conclusions

# Really good summary again


Here's a little something they don't teach ya in school, because it doesn't worK.

I, the Icarus of carbohydrates.

And the phone number for this was 1300 CYBER1. The planet may be dying, but we are truly living in an unparalleled age of content.


# What can you do with a passport?
* register to vote, get a sim card, get a license, etc. etc.



# This points to greater vulnerabilities
Maybe there's an API in the manage booking page that gives you all the secret info.

// abstract
Your boarding pass for a flight can sometimes be used to get your passport number. Don't post your boarding pass online, keep it as secret as your passport.

The Booking Reference on the boarding pass can be used to log in to the airline's "Manage Booking" page, which contains the passport number. I saw that former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had posted a photo of his boarding pass on Instagram, and was able to obtain his passport details, phone number, and internal messages between Qantas flight staff about his flight booking.

# Act 1: Sunday afternoon

Heyyyyyy you know when you're like, hanging out at home, flopping about, and drinking from from your water bottle in a way that does not possess _any_ intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia? 

It's a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in "the group chat"[^groupchat].

![Can you hack this man?](/img/sunburnt-country/groupchat.png)
*A nice message from my friend 🙂. A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences 🙂🙂🙂*

[^groupchat]: It's one of those group chats where the name is constantly changing and you have no idea who "illegally downloaded plant farmer" is.

### Tony Abbott
The man in question is [Tony Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott), one of Australia's many former Prime Ministers. 

![if u google tony abbott u get this](/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png)
*One of Australia's many former Prime Ministers*

You might be thinking "_"Many" former Prime Ministers? Surely you jest_". And yet I assure you I am deadly serious. 

![prime minsters google search since 2009 timeline](/img/sunburnt-country/pms.png)
*australia are you ok*

For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.[^kevin07]

[^kevin07]: Except Kevin Rudd, but that was _one time_ and we were kinda going through some stuff.

But like, don't get me wrong, I love Australia (let's be honest the [national anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR9iY5y94s) fricken slaps), I just really wanted to say that multiple websites thing.

## "Can you hack this man?"

My friend's message linked to a public Instagram[^instagram] post by Tony Abbott, showing a picture of a boarding pass and baggage receipt for a flight to Sydney. (Instagram, in case you don't know it, is an app you can open up on your phone any time to look at ads.)

[^instagram]: A lot of people don't know that Instagram is actually short for Instantaneous Grammarphone, because it isn't true.

![Instagram post showing boarding pass](/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG)
*The since-deleted Instagram post showing the boarding pass and baggage receipt. The caption reads "coming back home from japan 😍😍  looking forward to seeing everyone! climate change isn't real 😌 ok byeee"*

#### Boarding passes
My friend[^hoggemoade] (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking[^onbehalf] whether I can "hack this man" not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we'd recently been talking about boarding passes.

[^hoggemoade]: As for my friend's nickname being "𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊", I will not be providing context at this time.

[^onbehalf]: On behalf of _another_ friend, my many friends a consequence of my outstanding patriotic efforts towards continuing to avoid subversion of the Commonwealth of Australia.

I'd said that people post pictures of their boarding passes all the time, not knowing that it can sometimes be used to get their passport number and stuff. They just post it being like "omg going on holidayyyy 😍😍😍", unaware that they're posting cringe.

![screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram](/img/sunburnt-country/instagramboardingpasses.png)
*People post their boarding passes all the time, because it's not clear that they're meant to be secret*

Meanwhile, some hacker is rubbing their hands together, being all "yumyum identity fraud 👀" in their dark web Discord, because this happens a _lot_.

![screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram](/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpassposts.png)
*This happens a lot*



### Surely you wouldn't
Of course, when they messaged me, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊 wasn't _actually_ asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

𝑯𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

You _gotta_.

I mean... what are you gonna do, _not_ click it? Are you gonna let a _link_ that's like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn't you be _curious_? 

The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Was that _bad_? Was someone in danger? I didn't know. What I did know was: the _least_ I could do for my country would be to have a casual browse[^nocrime].

[^nocrime]: To be clear, I didn't want to go do some fun casual identity fraud, I just wanted to know if he _had_ posted something secret, since uh, someone should probably do something about that if it were true (I insist, as they calmly read me my rights). 

### Step 1: Hubris

A casual browse later, I had the picture of the boarding pass, but didn't really know what to do next.

I'd heard that it's bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a bored Russian 17 year-old boy called "Katie-senpai" might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don't know anyone like that, so I just clumsily googled some stuff.

![uhhh](/img/sunburnt-country/uhhboardingpasshacking.png)

Eventually I found [a blog post](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/) explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can be used for Crimes, and the valuable part is the barcode.

#### The Booking Reference is in the barcode
Apparently the barcode on the boarding pass contains the "Booking Reference" (e.g. `H8JA2A`), which you use, along with your last name, to log in to the airline website. That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but like I'm still fine to pretend it's not if you are.

### Step 2: Scan the barcode
I've been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can't scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn't work :((

//TODO replace with screenshot of photoshop
![](/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png)
*Maybe I shouldn't have blurred out the barcode first*

### Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more

Well, maybe it wasn't scanning because the picture was too blurry.

I spent around 15 minutes in an "enhance, ENHANCE" montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn't even get the barcode to scan[^step3].

[^step3]:You can't just _have_ step 3. You have to _earn it_.

### Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper

After staring at this image for fifteen minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is just... printed on the baggage receipt. 

I graduated university.

But it did not prepare me for this.

![Boarding pass with booking reference highlighted](/img/sunburnt-country/bookingrefhighlighted.png)
*askdjhaflajkshdflkh*

### Step 3: Visit the airline's website

Easy first step: I went to [qantas.com.au](https://qantas.com.au), and clicked "Manage Booking". Qantas is the main airline here in Australia, in case you live in a country with fast internet.

(I also very conveniently started recording my screen, which is gonna pay off _big time_ in just a moment.)

### Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference 

Well, the login form asked for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just effortlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well... I knew the last name[^lastname].

[^lastname]: The last name is printed on the baggage receipt, too. So even if I didn't know who posted the picture, everything you need to manage the booking is right there on the baggage receipt in a neat little package.

I hesitated for a split-second, but... no, I had to know.

## Step 5: Crimes(?)

![gif of me logging the hEck in](/img/sunburnt-country/summary.gif)
*Part of collection "Pictures taken moments before disaster" (2020), 1920x1080, RGB pixel on canvas*

So in the picture above it _looks_ a lot like I've just logged in to this plane website as 28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to Queen Elizabeth II, Tony Abbot. But it's actually fine because dslkhjflhajsakjhgsfhl

### Can I get a YIKES in the chat

Leave a YIKES in the chat if you really felt that.

I was now logged the heck in as Tony Abbott. And for all I know, everyone else who saw his Instagram post was right there with me.

But, well, let's not get carried away[^carriedaway]. The flight was in the past, so I couldn't change anything.

[^carriedaway]: hahahahahahahahaha

When I looked around the page, I saw Tony Abbott's name[^name], flight times, and Frequent Flyer number, but not really anything _super_ secret-looking. Not gonna be committing any cyber treason with a Frequent Flyer number.

[^name]: Which was "Anthony Abbott" #exposed #truthsout #dontbelieveeverythingyouhear #gaslighting

The page said the flight had been booked by a travel agent, so I guessed some information would be missing because of that.

I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length, but still didn't find anything secret-looking for my efforts.

At the very end, in what was a somewhat surreal experience, I was farewelled by an ad telling me (Tony Abbott?) to rent a car in Melbourne. 

![Car Ad](/img/sunburnt-country/sdff.png)
*No, Qantas, I shall not go gently into that good night. You don't understand.*

Some people might give up here. But me? I'm too dumb to know when to stop 😎😎😎

### We're not done just because a _web page_ says we're done

Having recovered from the emotional rollercoaster of the car ad, I looked at the page again, but like, harder.


#### Aside: Web page school with Alex
---------

Hey gang and welcome to: how does a website

Forgive me for stating the exasperatingly obvious, but when you go to [google.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroogled), it looks like this.

![google homepage](/img/sunburnt-country/google.png)
*google.com*

But what Google _actually_ sends to your computer is _this_:

![google homepage](/img/sunburnt-country/googlepagesource.png)
*The HTML (or "page source" or "page sauce") for google.com*

What? "But that's not the webpage you filthy hacker, that's some kind of `<pointy gang>` spaghetti." The tea is, it's both.

Google sends your computer the HTML above (although the technical term for it _is_ actually "`<pointy gang>` spaghetti"), and then _your_ computer turns that textual spaghetti into the nice colourful webpage you actually look at ads on[^complicated].

[^complicated]: If you think this is too complicated, don't worry. That's as complex as computers get. It's all downhill from here.

![html rendering diagram](/img/sunburnt-country/htmlrendering.png)

But, the HTML is still _there_, inside the page.

//So what if you wanna see what's inside an HTML page?

//For all you know there's an assortment of clowns in there. Surely you wanna check for yourself? I'm not _saying_ there's an unreasonable volume of clowns in there, just, maybe you wanna check.

Sometimes there are juicy things hidden in the page's HTML, because, well, someone left them there accidentally, or they're needed for the page to work. And of course, nobody's expecting you to look in the HTML, even though you totally can.

To see the HTML of a page, you have to... well....

------

### "Inspect Element"

![Right click > Inspect](/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png)

Listen. This is the only step in this story that might be considered "hacking". It's not, though. Maybe later someone will show you this same thing, and tell you it's hacking. You will not go gently into that good night. You will refuse to acknowledge their showing off, killing them instantly.

"Inspect Element", as it's called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer's internal representation (HTML) of the page you're looking at. Kinda like opening up a clock and looking at the cool cog party inside. 

![cog party](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Pocketwatch_cutaway_drawing.jpg)
*Yeahhh go little cogs, look at 'em absolutely going off. Now imagine this but with like, JavaScript*

Everything you see when you use "Inspect Element" was already downloaded to your computer, you just hadn't asked Chrome to show it to you yet. Just like how the cogs were already in the watch, you just hadn't opened it up to look.

But enough about cogs. Cheap tricks such as "Inspect Element" are used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: Nobody can understand how websites work. Unfortunately, it kinda _looks_ like hacking the first time you see it.

If you'd like to know more about it, I've prepared a short video.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey youtube welcome to my hacking tutorial, today we&#39;re gonna hack.... the nsa <a href="https://t.co/2Z35GJjSZE">pic.twitter.com/2Z35GJjSZE</a></p>&mdash; “Alex” (@mangopdf) <a href="https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


## Browsing the "Manage Booking" page's HTML

I scrolled around the page's HTML, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.

I eventually realised that manually reading HTML with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F'd the HTML for "passport".

![Blurred screenshot of me ctrl + F-ing "passport"](/img/sunburnt-country/)

## Oh _no_

![Blurred screenshot of close up "passport" number](/img/sunburnt-country/)

Oh yes.

I saw something called `documentNumber`, that sure _looked_ like a passport number. There was no name, but surely it was Tony Abbott's? Just in case, I googled "tony abbott" and checked the birthday on his Wikipedia page. It matched the birthday on the passport.

At this point I was fairly sure I was looking at the _extremely_ secret government-issued ID of the _28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II_ and I was _kinda_ worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop[^queen].

[^queen]: bro whenever things get tense u just talk about queen elizabeth

#### But why is it bad for someone else to have your passport number?

----------------

Hey crime gang, welcome back to Identity Fraud tips and tricks with Alex

Well, it's government-issued ID. It's how you prove you're you. Just having the information on the passport is not quite as powerful as the full physical passport, but it's still not good optics to post yours on Instagram.

With your passport number, someone could:

//todo lol
* Register a SIM card (and so get an internet connection that's traceable to you, not them)
* who knows what else, i wouldn't know bc i have never done a crime

## ....anything _else_ in this page?

Well damn if Tony Abbott's passport number is in here, maybe there's like wayyyyy more. Maybe this page goes off and there's the lost launch codes to the Sydney Opera House, or Harold Holt[^holt].

[^holt]: Backstory: Harold Holt was another former Prime Minster and we... lost him? He disappeared while going for a swim one morning. This is not a joke. We named Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Pool after him. I repeat, this is _not_ a joke. //todo references

Well, maybe there's a phone number. Searching for `phone` and `number` didn't get anywhere, but sometimes you gotta do a huge galaxy brain move. So I searched for `614`, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number, using my colossal and highly celestial galaxy brain. _That_ led me to something called `PNRRemarks`, which looked like this:

//todo replace with screenshot

```
RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 61[redacted passenger phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
```
In what is surely the subtweeting of the century, it also has a section saying "HITOMI CALLED RQSTING FASTTRACK FOR MR. ABBOTT". 

![Blurred picture of PNRRemarks section showing "hitomi called"]()

I realised this was like... Qantas staff talking to eachother _about_ Tony Abbott, but not _to_ him?. Hitomi must be requesting a "fasttrack" (I thought that was only a thing in movies???) from another Qantas employee. 

Hey for real though? For reeeal though? What is even going on here? Why do Qantas flight staff talk to eachother via this passenger information field? Why do they send the messages about you _to_ you when you manage your booking? I'll never know because I suddenly got distracted with

### Forbidden airline code

I realised the allcaps museli must be some airline code for something, and eventually found several ancient forbidden PDFs that explained some of the codes. 

Apparently, they're called "SSR codes" (Special Service Request). There are codes for things like "Vegetarian lacto-ovo meal" (`VLML`), "Vegetarian oriental meal" (`VOML`), and even "Vegetarian vegan meal" (`VGML`). Because I was curious about these codes, here's some for you to be curious about too (tag urself, I'm `UMNR`):

```
RFTV    Reason for Travel
UMNR    Unaccompanied minor
PDCO    Carbon Offset (chargeable)
WEAP    Weapon
DEPA    Deportee—accompanied by an escort
ESAN    Passenger with Emotional Support Animal in Cabin
```

Back to the phone number, it looked like this: `CTCM QF HK1 [phone number]`. Googling "SSR CTCM" led me to the [developer guide](https://guides.developer.iata.org/docs/ctcm) for some kind of airline association, which I assume I am basically a member of now.

![CTCM](/img/sunburnt-country/ctcm.png)
*`CTCM QF HK1` translates as "Contact phone number of passenger 1"*

#### Is the phone number actually his?
I thought maybe the phone number belonged to the travel agency, but I [checked](https://portal.iata.org/faq/articles/en_US/FAQ/Is-it-mandatory-for-travel-agents-to-provide-the-passenger-s-mobile-phone-and-email-address-1448977338174) and it has to be the passenger's real phone number. That would be, if my calculations are correct,,,, Tony Abbott's phone number.

## what have i done

I'd now found Tony Abbott's:
* Passport details
* Phone number
* Weird Qantas staff comments.

My friend who messaged me had _no idea_.

## what have i _done_

By this point I'd had enough defending my country and was thinking:

* _oh jeez oh boy oh jeez_
* _i gotta get someone, somehow, to reset tony abbott's passport number_
* _can you even reset passport numbers_
* _is it possible that i've done a crime_

# Act 2: The next four months

I contacted a _lot_ of people about this. If my calculations are correct[^calculations], I contacted at least `PLACEHOLDER_NUMBER` people. Eventually I started keeping track of who I talked to in a Google Keep note I now refer to as "the hashtag struggle". Here it is in spreadsheet form, so you can see my suffering:

[^calculations]: I've always wanted to say that.

![the hashtag struggle](/img/sunburnt-country/thehashtagstruggle.png)
*This is how much I went through to publish this blog post*

//todo make this into a graph diagram? of who I contacted, and who they told me to contact?

There is a _lot_ going on in this section (a loT), so here is a lil cheat code from present-day me: A checklist of what the heck I was trying to accomplish here.

- ⬜ figure out whether i have done a crime
- ⬜ notify someone (tony abbott?) that this happened
- ⬜ get permission to publish this here blog post 
- ⬜ tell qantas about the security issue so they can fix it

Alright strap yourself in as I am drop-kicked through the goal posts of life. 

## Part 1: is it possible that i've done a crime
I didn't _think_ anything I did sounded like a crime, but I knew that sometimes when the other person is rich or famous, things can suddenly _become_ crimes.

My usual defence against being arrested for hacking is making sure the person being hacked is okay with it. You heard me, it's the power of 🌸consent🌸. But this time I can uh only get it retroactively. Surely that'll be fine. Surely.

So I was wondering like... was logging in with someone else's booking reference a crime? Was _having_ someone else's passport number a crime? What if they were, say, the former Prime Minister? Would I get in trouble for publishing a blog post about it? I mean you're reading the blog post right now so obviousl

Update: I have been arrested.

### Just straight up Reading The Law
It turned out I could just google these things, and before I knew it I was reading "the legislation". It's the rules of the law, just written down. 

I have no trouble reading pages of HTML, but whoever wrote the legislation was straight up making up words. Eventually, I was able to divine the following wisdoms from the Times New Roman tea leaves:

* It's not defamation to publish something negative about someone if it's true
* Having Tony Abbott's passport number isn't a crime, but using it to commit identity fraud is
* The Laws About Computers are roughly: If u EVER even LOOK at a computer the wrong way, the FBI will instantly slam jam you into the shadow realm

I am possibly the furthest thing you can be from a lawyer, so I'm sure I don't need to tell you not to take this as legal advice. But, if you are the kind of person who takes legal advice from blog posts, who am I to stand in your way? Not a lawyer, that's who. Don't do it.

You know what, maybe I needed help. From an adult. With like, leather shoes. Maybe this was too hard for me to do on my own. "Yeah, maybe I should get some of that free government legal advice", I thought. That seemed like a pretty common thing, so I thought it should be easy to do. I took a big sip of water and googled "free legal advice".

### trying to ask a lawyer if i gone and done a crime

Before I went and told everyone about my HTML frolicking, I spent 9 days calling legal aid numbers, lawyers, and otherwise trying to figure out if I'd done a crime[^noplan]. 

[^noplan]: I'm not really sure what my plan was. If I had done a crime, what was I gonna do, not report the passport number being publicly available?

During this time, I didn't tell a soul what I'd done. I asked if any laws would be broken if "someone" had "logged into a website with someone's publicly-posted password and found the personal information of a former politician". Do you see how that's not even a lie? I'm starting to see how lawyers do it.[^clever]

[^clever]: This sounds like maybe I'm doing something remotely clever by not confessing my potential(?) crimes, but I also did this simultaneously while emailing explicit details of my activities to the Australian Government.

#### "Oh you've been given the run around": Calling Legal Aid places

First I call the state government's Legal Aid number. They tell me they don't _do that_ here, and I should call another Legal Aid place named something slightly different. The second place tells me they don't _do that_ either, and I should call the First Place and "hopefully you get someone more senior". I call the First Place again, and they say "oh you've been given the run around!". You see where this is going.

Let's skip a lot of phone calls here. Take my hand as I whisk you towards the slightly-more-recent past. Based on advice I got from two independent lawyers that was definitely not legal advice: I'm good, I haven't done a crime. 

Helllllll yeah. But I mean it's a little late because by this point I had already reported my actions to the Government.

- ☑️ figure out whether i have done a crime
- ⬜ notify someone (tony abbott?) that this happened
- ⬜ get permission to publish this here blog post 
- ⬜ tell qantas about the security issue so they can fix it

## Part 2: trying to report the problem to someone, anyone, please

I had Tony Abbott's passport number, phone number, and weird Qantas messages about him. I was the only one who _knew_ I had these. 

Anyone who saw that Instagram post could also have them. I felt like I had to like, _tell_ someone about this. Someone with like, responsibilities. Someone with an email signature.

### wait but do u see the irony in this, u have his phone number right there so u could just-

Yes I see it thank u for pointing this out, wise, astute, and ultimately self-imposed heading. I _knew_ I could just call the number any time and hear a "G'day" I'd never be able to forget. I knew I had a rare opportunity to call someone and have them ask "how did you get this number!?". 

But you can't just _do_ that.

You can't just call someone's phone number that you got by rummaging around in the HTML ball pit. Tony Abbott didn't _want_ me to have his phone number, because he didn't give it to me. Maybe if it was urgent, or I had no other option, sure. But I was pretty sure I should do this the Nice way, and show that I come in peace. 

I wanted to show that I come in peace because there's also this pretty yikes thing that happens where you email someone being all like "henlo ur website let me log in with username `admin` and password `admin`, maybe u wanna change that??? could just be me but let me kno what u think xoxo alex" and then they reply being like "oh so you're a HACKER and a CRIMINAL and you've HACKED ME AND MY FAMILY TOO and this is a RANSOM and ur from the DARK WEB i know what that is i've seen several episodes of mr robot WELL watch out kiddO bc me and my lawyers are bulk-installing tens of thousands of copies of [McAfee® Gamer Security](https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/gaming.html) as we speak, so i'd like 2 see u try"

### Surely you just contact Tony Abbott officially
I googled "tony abbott contact", but there's only his [official website](https://tonyabbott.com.au). There's no phone number on it, only a "contact me" form.

![Contact me form]()

Yeah right, have you _seen_ the incredible volume of #content people want to say at politicians? No way anyone's reading that form. I didn't even try it.

I eventually realised the place I want to be reporting this lil fun fact was probably the government.

## The government

It's a big place.

There are like fifty thousand million different departments, and they all know which acronyms to refer to eachother by, but you don't. If you EVER call it DMP&C instead of DPM&C you are gonna be email forwarded into a nightmare realm the likes of which cannot be expressed in _any_ number of spreadsheet cells. And believe me, they've lost a lotta good people trying. 

I didn't even know where to begin with this. I called Tony Abbott's former political party, who were like "uhhhh we dunno what to do with this, nor do we know who to ask, did u try the contact form on his website or". Skip skip skip a few more calls like this.

### The friends we made along the way

Well, maybe I knew someone who knew someone. I asked hacker friends who seemed like they might know government security people. "Where do I report a security issue with like.... a person, not a website?"

And I jus-

Look I don't really have a good explanation for this so I'm just gonna post the screenshots.

![Screenshot of 1300 CYBER1 chat](/img/sunburnt-country/cyber11.png)
*Me talking to a fellow hacker. It's culturally appropriate among hackers to have the dumbest profile pictures possible.*

![cyber1website](/img/sunburnt-country/cyber1website.png)
*Thanks but no thanks*

![Screenshot of 1300 CYBER1 chat second half](/img/sunburnt-country/cyber12.png)
*The planet may be dying, but we live in a truly unparalleled age of content.*

You _know_ I smashed that call button on `1300 CYBER1`. Did they just make it `1300 CYBER` then realise you need one more digit for a phone number? Incredible.

### Calling 1300 `c y b e r       o n e`

"Yes yes hello, ring ring, is this 1300 cyber one"? They _have_ to say yes if you ask that. They're legally obligated.

The person who picked up gave me an email address for [ASD](https://www.asd.gov.au/) (the Australian equivalent of the NSA), and told me to email them the details.

### Getting left on read by the government

I emailed ASD with the subject line "Tony Abbott's passport number and phone number publicly exposed". Sorry for the clickbait but well that's what happened???

They replied _instantly_ asking whether I was willing to share more details regarding the "potential" exposure of Tony Abbott's passport number. Yeah okay. The reply subject line had "[SEC=Sensitive]" in it so I _knew_ I'd made it big.

I sent them all the details of exactly how and what I found. Dates, times, IP addresses, everything. I also asked whether they could give me permission to publish this blog post, and they were all like "Seen 2:35pm".  Eventually, after another big day of getting left on read by the government, I got a response.

ASD were really nice to me about it and happy that I'd helped. They encouraged me to report this kind of thing to them if it happened again, but I'm not really in the business of uhhhhhhhh whatever this is.

At this point in the story (chronologically) I had not yet spoken to a lawyer, and so did not know whether the actions I was confessing to were of a highly illegal nature. This is widely regarded as a bad move, and I do not recommend anyone else rely on "but I'm being so helpful and earnest!!!" as a legal defence.

### Wholesomely emailing the government
At one point, the person I was emailing added a P.S. telling me their favourite colour[^nope]. This is the answer to my top secret mango.pdf challenge at the end of [mango.pdf.zone](https://mangopdf.zone). This is pretty poggers and everything, but:

[^nope]: This isn't actually true, it was their favourite something else. But it's the answer to my top secret mango.pdf puzzle, so of course I can't go giving it away here. Scroll to the bottom of [mango.pdf.zone](https://mango.pdf.zone) if you wanna try it! (You'll need a computer, not a phone.)

1. The instructions say to tweet the answer at me, not email me
2. The prize for doing the challenge is me sending you this gif of a shakas

![shakas.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/13JoHhCFtUMAZa/giphy.gif)
*yeahhhhhhhhhh, nice*

So I guess I emailed the shakas gif to the government??? Yeah, I guess I did.

![shakas attached dw](/img/sunburnt-country/shakas_attached.png)
*Please find attached*

The nice people at ASD didn't give me many details about what they were doing in response, though. They basically said "thanks kiddO we'll take it from here".

I asked them if they could give me permission to write this blog post, or who to ask, and they gave me two government email addresses. Listen I don't wanna be an "ummm they didn't reply to my emAiLs" kinda person buT they left me no choice.

Still, defending the Commonwealth was in ASD's hands now.

## Part 3: Telling Qantas the bad news

Okay, this time it's a company, so s u r e l y it'll be easier to report a security problem to them.

The first place to check is usually `company.com/security`, maybe that'll w-

![qantas security not found](/img/sunburnt-country/qantas_security_not_found.png)
*Okay nevermind*

Okay fine maybe I should just email `security@qantas.com.au` surely that's it? I could only find a phone number to report security problems to, and I wasn't sure if it was like.... airport security? 

So I just... called the number and was like "heyyyy uhhhh I'd like to report a cyber security issue?", and the person was like "yyyyya just email security@qantas.com.au" and i was like "oK".

I'd seen so many low-quality security issue reports, so I tried to write a real crispy one.

## Part 4: Finding Tony Abbott

Like 2003's _Finding Nemo_, this section was an emotional rollercoaster.

The government was presumably helping Tony Abbott reset his passport number, and making sure his current one wasn't being used for any of that yucky identity fraud.

But, much like Shannon Noll's 2004 _What About Me?_, what _about_ me? I really wanted to write a blog post about it, you know? So I could warn people about the non-obvious risk of sharing their boarding passes, and also make dumb and inaccessible references to the early 2000s.

The government people I talked to couldn't give me permission to write this post, so rather than willingly going deeper into the procedurally generated labrynth of government department email addresses, I realised I'd be better off asking Tony Abbott or his staff directly.

### Calling everybody in Australia one by one

I called Tony Abbott's former political party, and asked them how to contact him, or his office, or _something_. They said they weren't associated with him anymore, and suggested I call _Parliament House_, like I was the Queen or something.

![picture of parliament house](https://www.fma.com.au/sites/default/files/imagecache/event_full/uploaded-content/field_f_content_image/aph_from_website.jpg)

Parliament House is sorta like the White House, I think. The Prime Minister lives there and has a nice garden out the back with a macadamia tree, and everyone works in different sections and wears matching uniforms with lil kangaroo and emu hats, and they all do a little dance sometimes to celebrate another accident-free day in the Prime Minister's chocolate factory.

I didn't know you could just _call_ the uh chocolate factory, but sure enough, I just googled the phone number. 

I called up and was all like "yeah bloody g'day, day for it ay, hot enough for ya?". Once the formalities were out of the way, I skipped my usual explanation of why I was calling and just asked if they had contact details for Tony Abbott. 

The person on the phone sad, "oh, no, but I can put you through to the Serjant-at-arms, who can give you the contact details of former members". 
I was like ".....okay?????"
Was I supposed to know who that was? Isn't a serjant like an army thing?

But no, the Serjant-at-arms was just a nice lady who told me "he's in a temporary office right now, and so doesn't have a phone number. I can give you an email address or a P.O. box?".

I emailed the same thing I'd been emailing to everyone else to his email address, I guess? It was a bit weird just....emailing the former PM, but I figured if it was _that_ easy to get this email address, everyone had it, and so nobody was likely to be reading the inbox.

Spoilers: It didn't work.

### Giving the "Contact us" form one last go

Remember this?

![screenshot of contact us form]()

I thought "aw well, might as well slap something into this form with gusto even though nobody's gonna look at it. sure would be embarrassing if it was that simple and i never did it".

So I copy/pasted the same email I'd been sending to everyone in the form, and clicked "Submit". But the page didn't reload or anything, it didn't work. This had happened what feels like years ago, when I'd tried out the "contact us" form for the first time. 

I blew it off then, thinking that one of the sixteen privacy-enhancing Chrome extensions I had[^chromeextensions] was breaking the page somehow. That kinda thing happens sometimes when you're blocking all the JavaScript spaghetti that pages load from who knows where.

[^chromeextensions]: mmmm, love to enhance my privacy online by giving a whole bunch of chrome extensions that can just update silenty any time full access to every page i ever look at

So, I opened the page in a fresh, unmodified browser, and tried again. But the form still didn't submit? Suuuurely not.

Kinda in awe, I gave it the ol' right click -\> Inspect Element, to see whether any errors came up when I submitted the form.

![403 error]()

_What_. The form just _doesn't work?!_. Not just for me, for _everyone_? You can't just _do_ that.

Isn't anyone wondering why they're getting so few complaints from the general public!?

### Finding Tony Abbott's staff

Okay _this_ time for sure.

I was kinda lost for a few weeks, waiting hopelessly for various government departments to reply to my emails. "It's in their hands", I thought. But actually, the hands it was in,,,, were mine.

In a moment of determination/desperation/destiny, I went and asked everyone I could think of that _might_ know how to contact Tony Abbott's staff. 

I slid clumsily into the DMs of someone I found on Twitter who seemed to have sufficient #AusGov #Cyber in their bio, asking if they knew who to contact. They asked how my local police station would feel if I told them the same thing. Ah, no, big misunderstanding. I wasn't asking for help committing a crime or anything[^twitterdms].

[^twitterdms]: But, I do understand how it be sometimes. If you have anything remotely related to "hacking" in your Twitter bio, random people DM you asking you to hack their girlfriend's Instagram account. It sucks, and how was this person to know I wasn't one of those people?

I also messaged a journalist friend asking for help. They had ruthlessly efficient ideas that I presume came from, like, being a professional journalist. They suggested I find Tony Abbott's former staff from when he was PM, and contact their offices and see if they have his contact details.

### Wikipedia stalking

Apparently Prime Ministers themselves have "ministers", and those are their staff. That's who I was looking for.

![Screenshot of Tony Abbott's former staff]()

Okay but, the problem is that most of these people are retired now. The glory days of 2015 are over, I guess. Each time I hover over one of their names, I see "so-and-so is a former politician and....". Nope, not gonna cut it.

Eventually though, I saw _this_ minister.

![Screenshot of Scomo in the list]()
*Oh he _definitely_ has an office.*

That's the _current_ Prime Minister of Australia (at the time of writing, I can only pray that between now and publishing this remains true). 

### Let's call the Prime Minister's office I guess?

Easy google of the number, absolutely no worries this time. When I call, I hear what sounds like two women laughing. One answers the phone, slightly out of breath, and says "Hello, Prime Minister's office?".

I clumsily explain that I know this is Scott Morrison's office, but I actually was wondering if they had Tony Abbott's contact details, yes I know he's not in parliament anymore, it's for "a time-sensitive media enquiry". These were the magic words my journalist friend told me, for which I will be forever grateful, and keep close to my heart.

She says "We wouldn't have that information but I'll just check for you" and then pauses for like, a long time? Like 15 seconds? I can only wonder what was happening on the other end. Then she says "Oh actually I can give you Tony Abbott's personal assistant's number". Ummmm YES thanks buckle up everyone it's HAPPENING.

### Calling Tony Abbott's personal assistant's personal assistant

I fumble with my phone, furiously trying to dial the number.

I ask if I'm speaking to Tony Abbott's personal assistant. The person on the other end? He says he's one of Tony Abbott's staff[^hesaidyes]. It has been a long several months of calling people. The cold ice is starting to thaw. One day, I may be able to love again.

[^hesaidyes]: #hesaidyes?

I explain the security issue I want to report, and midway through he interrupts with "sorry who are you and what's the organisation you're calling from?" and I'm like "uhhhh I mean my name is Alex and uhh I'm not calling from any organisation I'm just like a person?? I just found this thing and...". 

The person is mercifully forgiving, and says that he'll have to call me back. I stress once again that I'm calling to work with them on this, happy to wait to publish until they feel comfortable, and am definitely not some kind of blackmailing hacker and they don't need to start bulk-installing McAfee products just yet.


### Calling Tony Abbott's personal assistant
An hour later, I get a call from a number I don't recognise. 

He explains that the guy I talked to earlier was _his_ assistant, and he's Tony Abbott's PA. Folks, we made it. It's as easy as that.

He says he knows what I'm talking about. He's got _the emails_. He's already in the process of getting Tony Abbott a new passport number. This is the stuff. It's all happening.

And _then_ he says:

"These things do interest him - he's quite keen to talk to you."

I was like exCUSE me? Former Prime Minister and 28th Hokage Tony Abbott wants to call me on the _phone_? I suppose I owe this service to my country?

This story is already completely cooked so sure, whatever, I don't even care. I've already delcared emotional bankruptcy, so nothing comes as a surprise at this point.

### Calling Tony Abbott

It was surprisingly pleasant.

Mostly, he wanted to check whether his understanding of how I'd found his passport number was correct (it was). He also wanted to ask how to learn about "IT".

He said something[^recording] about how if he was dropped in the middle of the bush, he could navigate his way out by looking at the sun and the direction of rivers "no worries". But "the IT"? Bamboozling.

[^recording]: I didn't record our call, I only took some notes, so this isn't a quote, oops. Looks like I'm not a professional journalist.

This was possibly the most pure and powerful Australian energy a human can possess. The raw energy did in fact travel through the phone speaker and directly into my brain, killing me instantly.

Later, he asked if there was some kind of book about the basics of IT, since he wanted to learn about it. Say what you will about Tony Abbott, but someone who's just been hacked wanting to educate themselves about how it happens? You gotta pay that. It was humanising. It made me realise that even famous people are just people too.

Anyway I hadn't heard of a book that was any good, so I told a story about my mum instead.

##### A story about my mum instead

I said there probably was a book out there about "the basics of IT", but it probably wouldn't help much. I didn't learn from a book. 13 year old Instagram stars don't learn from a book, they just _vibe_.

My mum (hi Mum) always said when I was growing up that there were "too many buttons", and she was afraid to press the buttons, because she didn't know what they did. 

That actually makes complete sense, because grown ups don't have the sheer dumb hubris of a child. Like, when a toddler uses a spoon for the first time, they don't know what time it is, where they are, or what the heck a spoon is. But they see the spoon and they see the cereal, and their dumb baby brain is just like "yeA" and they have a red hot go[^spoon]. And like, they get it wrong the first few times, but it doesn't matter, because they don't know to be afraid of getting it wrong. So eventually, they get it right.

[^spoon]: "Nobody gives the baby a knife. You give them a spoon" - Mum, when I showed her this.

![yeA](/img/sunburnt-country/baby-spoon.jpg)
*leaked footage of me learning how to hack*

Okay so I didn't tell the spoon thing to Tony Abbott, but I did tell him what I always told my mum, which was: "Mum you just gotta press _all_ the buttons, to find out what they do".[^mum]

[^mum]: But like, I didn't call _him_ "Mum", that would be weird, in startling contrast to the rest of this story.

He was like "oh, you just learn by trial and error". Exactly! Now that I think about it, and the whole baby analogy, that's kinda terrifying. Anyway good luck out there to all you big babies.

##### Publishing this blog post

When I asked Tony Abbott for permission to publish the post you are reading right now while neglecting your responsibilities, he said something like "well look Alex, I don't have a problem with it, you've alerted me to something I probably should have known about, so if you wanna do that, go for it!"

Look you gotta hand it to him. That's _exactly_ the right way to respond to a security issue! Back at the beginning, I was kinda worried that he might misunderstand, and think I was trying to hack him or something, and that I'd be instantly slam dunked into jail. But now you, a sweet and honourable blog post browser, get to learn the dangers of posting your boarding pass by the realest of real-world examples. 

The point of this story isn't to say "wow Tony Abbott got hacked, what a dummy[^dummy]". The point is that if it can happen someone famous, it can happen to anyone. 

[^dummy]: There are many, _many_ blog posts out there roasting Tony Abbott, if you came here looking for one.

Anyway that's why I vote right wing now baybeeeee.

- ☑️ figure out whether i have done a crime
- ☑️ notify someone (tony abbott?) that this happened
- ☑️ get permission to publish this here blog post 
- ☑️ tell qantas about the security issue so they can fix it

### Whoa how r u such a hacker I wish I could be a hacker like u
C'mon buDdY you read the blog post. You know this wasn't hacking. But I suppose I could,,,, detail my philosophy on hacking, unprompted.

//nah definitely make this into its own blog post
#### Unprompted and unnecessary philosophy on hacking and restaurant water

Oh so you're gonna read _this_ section huh?

One day in the kitchen, my housemate said "yeah I was thinking.... why didn't _I_ hack Tony Abbott? And I realised I guess it's because you have more hubris".

I was deeply complimented by this, but that's not the point. The point is that you, too, can have hubris. 

You know how they say to commit a crime (which once again I insist did not happen in my case) you need means, motive, and opportuity? Means is the ability to use right click > Inspect Element, motive is hubris, and opportunity is the dumb luck of having my friend message me the Instagram post.

I know, I've been saying "hubris" a lot. I mean "the willingness to risk breaking the rules". Now hold up, don't go outside and do crimes. I'm not talking about breaking the _law_. I'm talking about rules you might not even realise are rules, like social rules and conventions.

Here's a simple example. You're at a sufficiently fancy restaurant, like I dunno, with white tablecloths or something? The waiter asks if you'd like "still or sparkling water?"

If you say "still", it costs Eleven Dollars. If you say "sparkling", it costs Eleven Dollars and tastes all gross and fizzy. But if you say "tap water, please", what happens? It feels a bit risky. There are a lot of rules about how you're supposed to behave at fancy restaurants. Maybe the waiter will condescendlingly tell you "that's not how it works sweetie"

When I've seen someone say they'd like tap water, the waiter just brings tap water without a fuss. And it doesn't cost anything, of course.

In conclusion, to be a hacker u ask for tap water at a restaurant.

For real though, when I first saw someone do this I was blown away. You can _do_ that? I didn't know you could do that! I just thought you had to pay Eleven Dollars extra at fancy restaurants. It's not written down anywhere that you can ask for tap water. But now that I know you _can_ do that, and like, nothing bad happens, I can do it too. Miss me with that Eleven Dollars fizzy water.

Basically, until you've broken the rules, the idea that the rules can be broken might just not occur to you. That's how it felt for me, at least. I'm not trying to impress you with an edgy burst of performative wokeness, I swear.

// abstract
Your boarding pass for a flight can sometimes be used to get your passport number. Don't post your boarding pass online, keep it as secret as your passport.

The Booking Reference on the boarding pass can be used to log in to the airline's "Manage Booking" page, which contains the passport number. I saw that former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had posted a photo of his boarding pass on Instagram, and was able to obtain his passport details, phone number, and internal messages between Qantas flight staff about his flight booking.

* ask tony why the phone number is from christmas island

But sorry, let's get to know eachother. In 1633 I was excommunicated from the Catholic church for insisting the Earth revolves around the Sun.











#### Denial
_"Surely this can't be happening. SURELY anyone who saw that Instagram post couldn't be looking at this page with me right now."_

#### Anger
_"Why the hEcK are there so many versions of Minecraft for Windows 10, why the hEcK are there MineCoins™ this isn't the future Hatsune Miku wanted."_

#### Bargaining
_"Maybe this page doesn't have anything interesting in it."_

Suuuuuurely it's not thaaaaat bad. 

I mean sure I could see all this flight info, but it didn't look _that_ secret.The Frequent flyer number tho. Maybe that's a lil bit secret?

It said the flight had been booked by a travel agent, so some information would be missing.

But that's not _that_ bad. Right?

#### Depression
_"Oh, it doesn't have anything juicy. Aw, I was kinda excited."_

I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length, but still didn't find anything secret-looking for my efforts.

At the very end, in what was a somewhat surreal experience, I was farewelled by an ad telling me (Tony Abbott?) to rent a car in Melbourne. 

![Car Ad](/img/sunburnt-country/sdff.png)
*No, Qantas, I shall not go gently into that good night. You don't understand.*

#### Acceptance

For a brief, brief moment, I felt relieved. 

Maybe this wasn't such a big deal after all.
